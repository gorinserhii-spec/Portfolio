# 💼 Serhii Gorin – Portfolio & Projects

Hi! 👋 I'm **Serhii Gorin**, a motivated **Junior IT Specialist** and future **Network & Systems Engineer** with strong skills in networking, Linux administration, cybersecurity, and cloud technologies.

This repository serves as my **technical portfolio**, showcasing hands-on projects, certifications, and practical experience gained through internships and self-driven learning.

I am currently completing my education as a **Technik Informatyk** at Zespół Szkół Technicznych i Ogólnokształcących in Sandomierz, Poland, and actively seeking **internships or entry-level roles** in IT support, network administration, or system administration — open to relocation within the EU.

## 🚀 Key Projects

### 1. [Advanced Corporate Network with OSPF, IPv6 & GRE Tunnel](https://github.com/gorinserhii-spec/PacketTracer-Corporate-Network-Project)
> A scalable simulation of a corporate network with dynamic routing, IPv6, and QoS.

- Designed a multi-site topology with main office and branch.
- Configured **VLANs (10, 20, 30)** for traffic segmentation and security.
- Implemented **OSPFv2/v3** for dynamic IPv4/IPv6 routing.
- Set up **NAT (PAT)** for internet access and **GRE tunnel** for site-to-site connectivity.
- Applied **ACLs** to restrict inter-VLAN communication and **QoS** to prioritize critical traffic.
- Used **SLAAC** for IPv6 autoconfiguration and **DHCP** for IP management.
- Tools: Cisco Packet Tracer 8.2.2, Cisco 2911/2960 routers.

📌 *Demonstrates scalability, troubleshooting, and real-world network design.*

### 2. [Secure Corporate Network with DMZ, VPN & Firewall Rules](https://github.com/gorinserhii-spec/PacketTracer-VPN-NAT-DMZ-Lab)
> A secure enterprise network with IPsec VPN, DMZ, and hardened switches.

- Built a site-to-site **IPsec-protected GRE tunnel** for secure communication.
- Created a **DMZ** with static NAT to expose a public web server securely.
- Configured **Router-on-a-Stick** for VLAN routing (VLAN 10–30).
- Implemented **port security** on switches and **ACLs** to control traffic flow.
- Enabled **QoS** and tested end-to-end connectivity.
- Tools: Cisco Packet Tracer, Cisco 2911/2960.

📌 *Highlights network security, firewall logic, and enterprise best practices.*

### 3. [VLAN Segmentation & DHCP Lab](https://github.com/gorinserhii-spec/PacketTracer-VLAN-DHCP-Lab)
> A foundational lab demonstrating traffic isolation and automated IP assignment.

- Divided the network into multiple **VLANs** (management, user, server).
- Configured **Router-on-a-Stick** for inter-VLAN routing.
- Set up **DHCP pools** for automatic IP allocation.
- Used **static routing** to connect branch offices.
- Verified connectivity and documented configurations.

📌 *Shows understanding of LAN segmentation, IP management, and routing fundamentals.*

### 4. [Linux Security Automation: UFW + Fail2ban](https://github.com/gorinserhii-spec/Linux-Firewall-Automation)
> Bash scripts to automate Linux server hardening and monitoring.

- Developed an installer script to configure **UFW** (custom SSH port, logging).
- Integrated **Fail2ban** for automatic SSH brute-force protection.
- Created a **reporter script** that parses logs and generates Markdown reports.
- Demonstrates **Bash scripting**, **security automation**, and **system administration**.

📌 *Ideal for DevOps, security, or Linux admin roles.*

---

### 5. [Fail2ban Alerts via Telegram API](https://github.com/gorinserhii-spec/linux-fail2ban-telegram-alerts)
> Real-time monitoring system with external notifications.

- Built a Bash script that sends daily summaries of banned IPs to **Telegram** using `curl`.
- Second script generates an HTML status page updated by **cron**.
- Shows **API integration**, **log analysis**, and **scheduled automation**.

📌 *Proves ability to extend system tools for proactive monitoring.*

---

### 6. [Server Security Script with Fail2ban Reporting](https://github.com/gorinserhii-spec/linux-fail2ban-security)
> Automated log parsing and attack statistics generation.

- Script configures Fail2ban, analyzes logs, and outputs attack stats in Markdown.
- Tested on **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**.
- Focuses on **auditability** and **incident reporting**.

📌 *Useful for SOC, compliance, or system auditing roles.*
